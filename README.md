# Assignment 3 - Language modelling and text generation using RNNs

In this assignment, I am using a HuggingFace pipeline to classify both real and fake news headlines based on emotion. You can read more about the assignment in the *Assignment info.md* -file.

## Instructions

To run the code, first install the requirements by running the following command in terminal: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run the classifier by navigating to the "src" folder and running this command: `python3 -m emotion_classifier.py`

After it finishes (this will take several minutes), you will find a .csv and a .png file in a folder called "out" displaying the results.
